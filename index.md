## Welcome to 'Reconstructing Transmission with Genomic Data' at SISMID 2023

This site hosts all of the online materials for the course. 

For more details see [our module page on the SISMID website](https://si.biostat.washington.edu/institutes/sismid/MD2307).

### Schedule

The schedule is [available here](https://jessicastockdale.github.io/SISMID2023-transmission-genomics/Files/Mod7_schedule.pdf).

### Things to know

- The module will be delivered through a combination of lectures and exercise sessions. This site hosts all exercise materials, as well as additional info for the module.

- Some organization and additional data will be sent out through our module Slack channel. Please email us or SISMID if you have not been added to the Slack by the start of the course.


### Module Preparation

All computational exercises in this module will use R and Rstudio.

If you've never used R before, we have created a tutorial for you to work through in advance of the course. If you've already done a tutorial for one of the other SISMID modules or otherwise, that will be fine too. You can access the tutorial here: [An Introduction to R and RStudio](https://jessicastockdale.github.io/SISMID2023-transmission-genomics/Files/R_tutorial.html).

We have also created a short second R tutorial which walks you through installing all of the packages we'll be using during the module. Please work through this in advance of the course. If you have any problems, feel free to drop us a message on Slack. The second tutorial can be accessed here: [Installation and preparation instructions](https://jessicastockdale.github.io/SISMID2023-transmission-genomics/Files/R_tutorial2.html). **Note: everyone should do this one!**

In addition, for participants new to genomic sequencing and genomic data, we ask you to watch the following Youtube lecture in advance of the course, which provides a short primer on relevant aspects of the field to our course
